# Devpass Frontend Engineer Test #1

## What is expected?

We love GitHub! 🐙 ❤️ 

In this test, you have to develop an app that connects to the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest), lists all public repositories from an user, and shows last commits for the repositories.

## Requirements

### 1. Connect to GitHub API 📡
Connect to GitHub API, and create a page that lists all public repositories from a user. Implement a text field so it is possible to load repositories for different users!

### 2. Load commits 👩‍💻

After a repository is clicked, the app must show a page with the last 20 commits on that repository, also a search field for filtering the commits by the term inserted into the field.

### Solution
- Use Javascript/Ecmascript;
- Use any frontend framework you want (React, Vue.js, Angular, etc);
- Use HTML;
- Use CSS (SCSS/SASS, PostCSS);
- Implement a responsive layout;
- Support for IE9+, Chrome, Safari and Firefox;
- Write unit tests and any other test you may find helpful or important to have;
- Keep performance and corner cases in mind;
- Be creative and show us what you got.

### Bonus
- Endless scrolling for the commits page;
- Make it possible to change the order the repositories are shown (By stars, name, etc);
- Use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/);
- Automated UI tests.

## Delivery
- Create a new repository in your account and send the URL to contato@devpass.com.br;
- Create a README file with the instructions to run the project and the tests, explain your solution and add any comment that you think is relevant. [Take a look at this awesome README template](https://github.com/elsewhencode/project-guidelines/blob/master/README.sample.md).

## Evaluation Method

- Good practices and patterns;
- Code and folder structure;
- Code readability;
- Componentization and data flux;
- Easy to understand code;
- Commit history (no single commit, please);
- We (also) love tests! 🤓
